In this thesis I investigate Linked Data approaches to implementing FAIR Research Objects and sharing reproducible Computational Workflows.

\section{Research Outline and Questions}

I explore three research questions on this topic:

\paragraph{RQ1:} Can the FAIR Digital Object concept be realized using Web technologies?

\paragraph{RQ2:} Can pragmatic use of Linked Data practices implement FAIR Research Objects for scholarly communication?

\paragraph{RQ3:} How can we use improve reproducibility and shareability of Computational Workflows?


\subsection{Aims of FAIR Digital Objects on the Web (RQ1)}

\emph{FAIR Digital Object} (FDO) has been proposed as a machine-actionable ecosystem of scholarly outputs \cite{Schultes 2019}, in theory realizing the FAIR principles \cite{Wilkinson 2016} for a programmable mesh of strongly typed objects that go beyond the open data publication practices that the FAIR guidelines have popularized \cite{Jacobsen 2020}.

The FDO specifications \cite{fdo-Overview} are conceptual in nature, however most existing Digital Object implementations \cite{Kahn 2006} rely on the DOIP protocol \cite{DigitalObjectInterface} and the Handle system \cite{rfc3650}, neither of which are particularly familiar to software developers.

The Web, on the other side, is ubiquitous in modern software engineering \cite{Taivalsaari 2021}, used for everything from user interfaces, mobile applications and controlling devices to enterprise cross-platform integrations, backend data processing and microservices, frequently utilising cloud computing which itself is controlled using Web technologies \cite{Marinescu 2022}.

A research question (RQ1) therefore is if the promising FDO concept can be realised using existing Web technology, taking into account the lessons learnt from the early Semantic Web developments and more recent Linked Data practices. 


\subsection{Aims of FAIR Research Objects (RQ2)}

\emph{Research Objects} (RO) \cite{Bechhofer 2013} have been proposed as a mechanism to capture a range of diverse scholarly outputs in a single archivable item, with detailed metadata to. The RO concept was first realized using Semantic Web ontologies \cite{ch5-92,Belhajjame 2015} these approaches primarily targetted long-term preservation of computational workflows, utillised by RO as a mechanism to capture computational methods.

The principles of Research Objects extend far beyond workflows, RO implementations still mainly focused on capturing software \cite{goble-ro2018}. To some extent the lack of wider adoption of ontology-based ROs can also be explained by developers of researcher-facing software and platforms (e.g. repositories, data management systems) having a lack of familiarity with use of Semantic Web technology -- or worse, they have tried and then struggled \cite{carrieroLandscapeOntologyReuse2020a,Tudorache 2020}.

Following the lessons learnt on early RO implementations and the emerging FAIR principles \cite{Wilkinson 2016,Jacobsen 2020}, a small community in digital libraries agreed to formulate a lightweight approach to Research Objects \cite{Sefton 2018,10.5281/zenodo.3337883} for the purpose of data packaging. The updated aims of \emph{FAIR Research Objects} can be summarised as:
 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe and package data collections, datasets, software etc. with their metadata
    \item Platform-independent object exchange between repositories and services
    \item Support reproducibility and analysis: link data with codes and workflows
    \item Transfer of sensitive/large distributed datasets with persistent identifiers
    \item Aggregate citations and persistent identifiers
    \item Propagate provenance and existing metadata
    \item Publish and archive mixed objects and references
    \item Reuse existing standards, but hide their complexity
\end{itemize}

The second research question (RQ2) is if a more pragmatic use of Linked Data practices can better implement Research Objects for a wider developer audience, by using familiar Web technologies and give lightweight recommendations.


\subsection{Aims of FAIR Computational Workflows (RQ3)}

\emph{Computational Workflows} (or Scientific Workflows) are used to structure and automate a data analysis pipeline so that it can be scalable, portable and explainable \cite{Atkinson 2017}. There exists a plethora of workflow systems \cite{Leipzig 2021} and languages \cite{Amstutz 2021}, recent effort have also specified a Common Workflow Language \cite{Crusoe 2022} that is implemented by multiple engines. 

Research Software \cite{Katz 2021a}
Notably, workflow definitions themselves can be considered FAIR scholarly outputs \cite{Goble 2020} and are published in repositories including Dockstore \cite{Yuen 2021} and WorkflowHub \cite{Goble 2021}.

%Workflows produce provenance, but in which format? 

The third research question (RQ3) therefore is we can unify better the approach to workflow provenance in a way that is more focused on data and the context of the workflow, as well as being possible to consistently implement by developers of workflow management systems.


\section{Main Contributions}

The contributions from this PhD provide:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An evaluation of FAIR Digital Objects and Linked Data, considering them from a developer perspective as distributed object systems.
    \item A Research Object implementation based on familiar Web technologies, adapted and extended by numerous research projects and software developers.
    \item A profile to capture provenance of computational workflow runs using this implementation, implemented by at least six workflow management systems.
\end{itemize}

These contributions have not evolved in isolation, but in co-development with multiple international collaborations (see appendix \vref{ch11:acknowledgements}).


\section{Thesis Overview}

Chapter \vref{chapter:background} gives the background of concepts \emph{FAIR Digital Object} (FDO) and \emph{Linked Data}, including a brief history of the \emph{Semantic Web} and a critical analysis of these technologies and their use. 

Chapter \vref{chapter:fdo} consider RQ1 and contributes a framework-based evaluation of Linked Data and FDO as possible architectures for implementing a distributed object system for the purpose of FAIR data publishing, and discusses how the two approaches can benefit from each others strengths. 

Chapter \vref{chapter:ro-crate} RQ2 by introduces the contribution of \emph{RO-Crate}, a pragmatic data packaging mechanism using Linked Data standards to implement FDO and be extensible for domain-specific metadata.  

Chapter \vref{chapter:workflows} address RQ3 by exploring the relationship between Computational Workflows and FAIR practices using RO-Crate and FDO, with use cases from molecular dynamics and specimen digitization. The contribution of the \emph{Workflow Run Crate profiles} is presented as an interoperable way to capture and publish workflow execution provenance. 

Chapter \vref{chapter:conclusions} summarizes and concludes the contributions from this thesis, and reflects on later developments and future work.
