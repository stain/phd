To investigate \textbf{RQ1} (\vpageref*{rq1}) this chapter evaluates both 
\acrlong{LD}
%Linked Data 
and 
\acrfull{FDO}
%FAIR Digital Object (FDO) 
as ways to realize the FAIR principles. Section \ref{ch3:evaluating-fdo-ld} compares the two approaches as global distributed object systems, and discusses what lessons can be learnt across the communities, taking into consideration the history covered by section \ref{chapter:background}.

Section \ref{ch2:updating-linked-data-practices-for-fair-digital-object-principles} proposes how the FDO principles can be achieved using Linked Data standards, which is explored further in the following chapters.
