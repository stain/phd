\section{Community roles}

For section \ref{ch2:updating-linked-data-practices-for-fair-digital-object-principles} and section \ref{ch6:making-canonical-workflow-building-blocks-interoperable-across-workflow-languages} I am a member of FAIR Digital Object Forum \cite{FAIRDigitalObjects} working groups FDO-CWFR, FDO-SEM and have contributions to FDO specifications \cite{fdo-RequirementSpec}, \cite{fdo-Overview}, 

For sections \ref{ch4:lightweight-fdo}, \ref{ch5:packaging-research-artefacts-with-ro-crate},  \ref{ch5:formaldefinition} I co-chair the
\footurl{https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/community}{RO-Crate
community}\footnote{see section \vref{ro-crate-community}} together with Peter Sefton. We are the main editors and authors of the RO-Crate specifications \cite{ch5-105,ch5-107,ch5-106}.

For section \ref{ch6:making-canonical-workflow-building-blocks-interoperable-across-workflow-languages} I was deputy work package leader in BioExcel-2, with Adam
Hospital as work package leader.
