        description={
        The Handle system \cite{Sun 2003a,Sun 2003b} is a distributed
        identifier system for digital objects. Unlike DNS, which generally only address machines and not individual resources, in the Handle system each identified object (handle) has its own registration with a set of key/value strings. 
        Pre-defined keys can be used for data retrieval from a server, but each handle is free to use additional keys -- the Handle protocol is also used for creating/updating handles. 
        Many proponents of Persistent Identifiers argue for the use of the Handle system, however not all handles are persistent identifiers.
